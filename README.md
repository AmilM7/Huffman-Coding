# Huffman-Coding
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. Here, you can find implemented Huffman-Coding using Java.
Mostly, there are two major parts in Huffman Coding:
1. to build a Huffman Tree from input characters
2. to traverse the Huffman tree and assign numbers/codes to characters
